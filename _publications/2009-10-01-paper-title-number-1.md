excerpt: 'Load frequency control (LFC) aims to stabilize grid frequency fluctuations by countering load disturbances with
generation-side controllers. In smart grids, demand response (DR) and electric vehicles (EV) offer alternatives to
traditional frequency control, reducing reliance on costly generation-side controllers. These decentralized controls, interconnected through a shared communication medium, form a cyber-physical system, vulnerable to
challenges like packet drops and false data injection (FDI) attacks. Additionally, consumer participation in DR
introduces significant time delays. This paper derives stability conditions for LFC using a state feedback
controller, estimating unobservable states with an observer while accounting for bounded disturbances and
noise. This cyber-physical system, involving an observer, controller, and network, is modelled as an observerbased networked control system (NCS) using an asynchronous dynamical system (ADS) approach. The resulting switched system model is used to establish linear matrix inequality (LMI) criteria that ensure stability and
determine observer and controller gains under specified packet drop rates, disturbances, and noise. The methodology is tested on various configurations, demonstrating that decentralized EV with LFC and DR improves
system response, minimizes frequency fluctuations, and optimizes networked control bandwidth under given
conditions'
